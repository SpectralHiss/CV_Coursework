To run any of this code first load matlab on any ITL machine
make sure to change directory to sw/ 
this is important as some code saves output to out/
and reads input from Dataset/ in some cases.

Example invocation for question 1:

I have generated an image as requested in Q1 using GIMP and it is in 'Dataset/Houssem.png'

ICV_Q1_imRotate('Dataset/Houssem.png', 10,0);

This will read image in 'input/Houssem.png'
and Rotate it by 10 degrees display and return it.
Should you want to save an image you can use matlab's in-built imwrite and in fact this is what i used to save the results manually
imwrite(ICV_Q1_imRotate(blah,blah), 'out/OUTPUT.png');

Example invocation question 2

This question takes as input the name of the input image to filter and generates all the figures and plots as well as saves the ones attached in report.
ICV_Q2_filter('Dataset/DatasetA/car-2.png')

Example invocation question 3

This is simply ICV_Q3_histogram()

Possible Gotchas!

Q1. Please note thae i saved the output manually for Question 1 using imwrite. ( the script doesn't save any images unlike other questions.

Q2. whatever image you put in path in Q2 will overwrite the pre-computed output images
that are attached in report. You can regenerate them by running Q2 with ICV_Q2_filter('Dataset/DatasetA/car-2.png').

Q3 for saving the histograms with the right legends it was easier
for me to load them in matlab and to save the plot using the GUI

Pardon my lack of experience with matlab.
